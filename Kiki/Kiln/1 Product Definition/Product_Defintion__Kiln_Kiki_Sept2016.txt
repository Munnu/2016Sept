Product Description:  Arduino Kiln Controller

Introduction:
The Kiln is for processing neon and plasma artwork.  An electrode is attached to a recycled bottle using glass solder.  The kiln melts the solder and also heats the bottle to drive off moisture and other contaminants while the bottle is held at the required temperature for 20 minutes.  Then, the kiln turns off to prevent hot spots from the element turning back on and off while a vacuum is drawn on the bottle while it is still hot.  After the bottle has cooled completely under vacuum, a mixture is added to the bottle, while the electrode is attached to a plasma globe power source to dynamically adjust the plasma effect.  When the desired effect is attained, the bottle is removed from the gas manifold by melting the tubulation to keep it sealed from air.  The bottle is removed from the kiln.

Operational Requirements:
    - must be able to process the blue bottle: 12”x9”x24” (and smaller bottles)
        - height must include 3” (electrode) and 1” raised platform for bottle
        - must have an air gap between the elements and bottle of 2”
    - must be able to get hot enough to melt glass solder at ??? DegF
    - must be able to get to ??? max temp within 1 hour
    - must not have hot spots to cause glass to break

    - must be able to ramp slowly for thick bottles
    - tubulation must be able to reach the pumping station
    - the induction coil must be able to reach the electrode
    - must be mobile to store when not in use (either light or wheels if heavy)

Notes:
Can upgrade to adding another indicator for "ready" when the unit has heated and reached a new temp
Can upgrade to a power switch, to turn on and off the heating states without unplugging.
    This switch can go with to the Arduino, or simple be a safety cutoff between the high currnet switch and Arduino
